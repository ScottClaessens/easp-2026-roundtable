# EASP 2026 Roundtable

Slides, abstract, and R code for roundtable discussion at EASP 2026.

To run the code, you will need to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and 
the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("brms", "countrycode", "ggrepel", "haven", "patchwork", 
                   "readxl", "tarchetypes", "targets", "tidyverse"))
```

You can then run the code by running `targets::tar_make()` in your R console.
